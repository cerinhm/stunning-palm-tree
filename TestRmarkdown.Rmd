# Title

## Subheading

### Subsub

In this section I decided to use data from Jarvis et al. (2014), which I need to log transform, edit names, and match taxonomy.

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
x <- 1:100
y <- rnorm(100)
```


```{r}
plot(x, y)
```

Somehing else to try, perhaps. 
```{r}
dots <- read.csv(file = "rawdata/ladybirds.csv")
habitat_colour <- lm(number ~ Habitat + colour, dots)
plot(habitat_colour)
```
